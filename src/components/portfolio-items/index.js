								<h6>SALUD!</h6>
								<p>
									Salud! was a labor of love for its creators. In the week and a
									half we had to build Salud!, we learned and implemented both
									Angular and JSON Web Tokens. We built our database from
									scratch using MySQL and Sequelize, and used ngBootstrap for
									front-end styling. The idea grew from a desire to have a
									lightweight, unintrusive way to find and save our favorite
									cocktail recipes. We hope this app makes the good times better
									for anyone who uses it!

								<h6>EAT DA BURGER</h6>

									MySQL were used to query and route data in the app, while
									Handlebars was used to generate the HTML.
